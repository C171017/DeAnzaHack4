3. Or manually revert changes

Key features at this checkpoint:
- Complete page navigation system (Home -> Blank -> Page3 -> Page4)
- Data persistence with DATTAA and TAGGSS in localStorage
- Free movement system: music bubbles move freely without fixed positions
- Forgiving positioning with dead zone (15px) to prevent shaking
- Dynamic physics: attraction strength varies based on distance
- Position stability: bubbles maintain position when close enough
- Micro-movement prevention: stops tiny oscillations
- Natural positioning through physics and collisions
- Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop tag bubbles
- Smooth physics-based music bubble attraction system
- Boundary constraints for canvas bubbles
- Smooth animations and transitions

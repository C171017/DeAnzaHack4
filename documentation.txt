# Hacksify Project Documentation

## Overview
Hacksify is a web application that visualizes music taste as interactive, magnetic bubbles. It uses D3.js for physics simulations and React for the UI.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Data Recording & Mock Data
- **File**: `src/data/albums.json`
- **Purpose**: To allow the application to function without requiring every user to log in with Spotify, we have recorded a set of mock album data.
- **Structure**: The JSON file contains an array of album objects, each with:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Album name
  - `artists`: Array of artist objects
  - `images`: Array of album art images
  - `release_date`: Release date string
  - `total_tracks`: Number of tracks
  - `external_urls`: Links to Spotify

- **Integration**: `App.jsx` has been modified to load this data by default if the user is not authenticated. This ensures a seamless "demo mode" experience.

### 2. Magnet Feature
- **File**: `src/components/BubbleChart.jsx`
- **Description**: A new interactive feature that allows users to control the bubbles with their mouse or finger.
- **Interaction**:
  - **Desktop**: Click and hold the left mouse button.
  - **Mobile**: Touch and hold the screen.
- **Physics Implementation**:
  - When the magnet is active (`mousedown`/`touchstart`), the default "center" force of the D3 simulation is disabled.
  - A new `forceX` and `forceY` is applied, pulling all nodes towards the current cursor/touch coordinates.
  - The `alphaTarget` is increased to `0.3` to keep the simulation active and responsive during the drag.
  - Upon release (`mouseup`/`touchend`), the attraction forces are removed, and the default center force is re-enabled, allowing bubbles to settle back to the center.

## Technical Details
- **D3 Force Simulation**: The core of the visualization. It uses `forceManyBody` for repulsion (preventing overlap) and `forceCenter` for keeping bubbles on screen. The magnet feature dynamically modifies these forces.
- **React Integration**: The D3 simulation is wrapped in a `useEffect` hook to integrate with React's lifecycle. Event listeners for the magnet feature are attached to the `window` and `svg` elements to ensure global capture of mouse movements.

## How to Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the local server URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
4. The app will load with demo data. Click and hold to test the magnet!

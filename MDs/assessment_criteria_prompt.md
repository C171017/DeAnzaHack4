# Assessment Criteria Prompt

I want you to evaluate items (albums, tracks, or any media) using **clean and consistent assessment criteria**.  
Here are the rules you must follow when assigning categories or scores:

## 1. Use Only Broad Genres
Allowed genres:
- Rock
- Pop
- HipHop
- R&B
- Soul
- Electronic
- Metal
- Folk
- Jazz
- Country

(No sub-genres. No hybrid labels. No slashes.)

## 2. Top 3 Genres
For each item, identify the **top 3 most relevant genres**, ranked from most to least dominant.

## 3. Weighting Scale (1–10)
Assign each genre a weight from **1 to 10**:
- **10** = overwhelmingly dominant
- **1** = faint influence  
Use the **full range** rather than clustering scores around 8–10.

## 4. No Sub-genres or Hybrids
Do not use combined genres like “Pop/Rock” or sub-genres like “Shoegaze.”  
Map all specifics to the closest broad genre.

## 5. Consistency and Accuracy
Base weights on real musical identity and history.  
Avoid arbitrary assignments.

## 6. Required Output Format
```
Item Name:
1. Genre A — X
2. Genre B — Y
3. Genre C — Z
```

## 7. Assign Nearest Valid Genre When Unclear
If something doesn’t clearly match a broad genre, choose the nearest valid category using informed judgment.
